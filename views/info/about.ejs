        <span class="title is-2 mr-2">Kathleen Redly</span> is an expressionist artist based in Geneva, Switzerland. She is motivated by her desire to share beauty, joy, an impression, an emotion. Water in all its forms, light, flowers, nature, and many other subjects inspire her. She sees the world as a series of coloured compositions. Kathleen expresses herself through painting, often using mixed media, in which ink, with its saturated colours, frequently plays a central role. She enjoys using the natural properties of water media to create atmosphere and prefers to paint on a wet surface, in order to take full advantage of these.  Photography, which she edits using the program RawTherapee, is another of Kathleen's preferred media. In her frequently atmospheric images, composition, movement, and colour harmonies are key.

        Kathleen is passionate about ICM (Intentional Camera Movement) photography, and experimental methods that lend themselves well to expressionism. Her photographs are often very abstract and she paints with her camera as well as with brushes. Her paintings are also quite abstracted, generally, and often are inspired by memories, impressions, inner states. Sometimes she plans her work out in a detailed way, but more often she works in a more spontaneous, responsive way. Most of her paintings have many layers of washes. Whether it's created by what she calls "hands dirty art" or digital photography, the image always has the last say as to what it needs.

        Kathleen was born in Canada into a family that really valued art. She did some studio art classes in University and started her art career with a couple of duo exhibits in the nineties in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, her home town, under her maiden name, Bowman. When living in Montreal in the early nineties, the energy and beauty of the city lights at night inspired her to create a series of oil pastel nocturne cityscapes , which she then exhibited in her first exhibition. She moved away from visual art while raising her family, but felt a strong urge to return to it and enrolled in an local art workshop for adults in her community in Switzerland a couple of year ago. It was in this workshop that she discovered how much she loves to work with ink.

        Over the past couple of years, Kathleen has regained her passion for creating visual art and has exhibited her paintings and photography in several venues in Geneva, her home of over a decade. Most recently she was invited as a guest artist to exhibit with the SSBA-GE (Société Suisse des Beaux-arts, Geneva section) at the Chapelle des Arts in Geneva at a group exhibition entitled “Histoires d’eau”. The exhibition, which took place in September 2022, was a wonderful opportunity for eight local artists to show their unique interpretations on the theme of water. She hopes to exhibit internationally in the next few years and has done so online in a Tebbs Contemporary online exhibition called Dreamscapes. She is @katheen_redly on Instagram, and KatImages on Facebook and on Redbubble.com,  if you would like to see more of her work.  Kathleen is a member of the Visual Artists Association.
